## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues strictly. If you discover a vulnerability, please do **NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, please contact the maintainer directly via email or private message:
-   **Email**: dava@example.com (Replace with actual email if public)
-   **GitHub**: [MDF05](https://github.com/MDF05)

We will respond within 48 hours to acknowledge the receipt of your report.

## Security Best Practices

-   **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files with real credentials.
-   **Dependencies**: We regularly update `go.mod` to patch vulnerable dependencies.
